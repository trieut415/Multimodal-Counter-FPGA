In this project, we designed and implemented a sequential circuit system using Verilog, focusing on a debouncer, an 8-bit counter, and a 7-segment display driver for the Nexys-A7 FPGA board. The debouncer ensured clean signal transitions for push-button inputs, while the counter incremented accurately with each button press. For the second part, we extended the counter to 16 bits, added a 7-segment display driver to showcase the counter values, and incorporated two modes of operation: manual counting via button press and automatic counting using a 1Hz clock signal. Clock dividers synchronized the design across multiple clock domains, and thorough testing ensured reliable operation across all modules.
